# DAC test (GHDL)

This test verifies the correct operation of DAC `serial_dac856x` module located in `wr-cores/modules/wr_dacs` directory and is based on `wr-cores/testbench/dac/serial_dac856x_tb.vhd`.

The simulation is performed through [**VUnit**](https://github.com/VUnit/vunit/) framework using [**GHDL**](https://github.com/ghdl/ghdl) simulator.
