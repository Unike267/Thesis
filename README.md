## Abstract

Repository to store some stuffs of my thesis.

## Initial Research document

Document that includes information regarding the concepts of the thesis. 
Initial approach.

This document is generated in CI (Continuous Integration) through the following container:

- `ghcr.io/unike267/containers/latex-pygments:latest`

The generated PDF file is available in [releases](https://github.com/Unike267/Thesis/releases). 

In addition to this, this file is available in the repository [actions](https://github.com/Unike267/Thesis/actions). 

- Workflow: `docs` 

- Artifact name: `INITIAL_RESEARCH_DOC`

## Simulations

Currently, only the module named `serial_dac856x` is being simulated using my custom VUnit testbench based on the test `serial_dac856x_tb.vhd`, which is located in `/wr-cores/testbench/dac/`.

Both the generated waveform and the CSV results from the CI execution of the testbench are uploaded as artifacts in the `Simulation` workflow (Job `DAC_serial_dac856x`). 
These files are also attached to the assets of the Release starting from version `v0.2`, with the names `wave_dac.vcd` and `tb_dac.csv`.
 
## GOAL

To perform this ASIC:
